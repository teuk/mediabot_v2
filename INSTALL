Installation of Mediabotv2 Last revised: Feb 04, 2018

INSTALLING Mediabotv2

You need to install MySQL or MariaDB first (refer to documentation depending on your linux distribution).

YOU NEED A MYSQL USER AND ITS PASSWORD WITH CREATE DATABASE RIGHTS (USUALLY ROOT) TO BE ABLE TO RUN configure SCRIPT !

Create a non-privileged user for the bot (ex : mediabot).

as root user :

# useradd -m mediabot

You will then need to add sudo rights for it for the configuration stage (you can remove this right after).

If /etc/sudoers file does not exist install "sudo" package (on debian : apt-get install sudo)

As root user add the following line to /etc/sudoers (use : visudo /etc/sudoers)

mediabot   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Then change user to mediabot with

# su - mediabot

Then git clone the source code (you may install "git" package before, on debian : apt-get install git) :

$ git clone https://github.com/teuk/mediabot_v2

Run ./configure and follow all steps

$ cd mediabot_v2
$ ./configure

WHAT IF I GET :

"You should install make utility on your system before installation."

Install "gcc" and "make" packages (on debian : apt-get install build-essential)

"You should install MySQL server and client (at least client) on your system before installation."

Install MySQL or MariaDB server packages (on debian : apt-get install mysql-server)

"Checking DBD::mysql Can't locate DBD/mysql.pm in @INC" (on Ubuntu)

On Ubuntu install package default-libmysqlclient-dev : apt install default-libmysqlclient-dev

RUNNING Mediabotv2

After configuration you should have a configuration file generated by configure (ex : mediabot.conf)

You can launch the bot with commands (first check) :

./mediabot.pl --conf=mediabot.conf

If you get :
"Can't locate DateTime.pm in @INC"

Then rerun ./configure

or then in daemon mode

./mediabot.pl --conf=mediabot.conf --daemon


FIRST START

When the bot starts, it will try to connect on a random server of the network defined in config file (mediabot.conf) under [connection] clause :

[connection]
CONN_SERVER_NETWORK=MyNetwork

By running configure you should have added one irc server for this network.

If you want to have more servers or setup another network run ./configure -s


LOG FILE

You can consult the log file name mediabot.log by default


Read COMMANDS files to know how to register it at first use and refer to bot log file to know what is going on.
